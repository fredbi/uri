# Frequently asked question

* URI, URL, what's the difference?
  TODO: putting out a simple explanation is harder than you think :)

  A URI can be further classified as a locator, a name, or both.
  The term "Uniform Resource Locator" (URL) refers to the subset of URIs that,
  in addition to identifying a resource, provide a means of locating the resource
  by describing its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network "location").
