# Proposal for a V2

## Should feel more like `net/url.URL`

1 Make `uri.URI` a concrete type (theoretically a breaking change, but most likely with a small impact on actual usage):
  * The interface abstraction comes at a cost, and there is no palatable benefit from it
  * More methods from `URL` should be supported by `URI` (e.g. `MarshalBinary()`, `Redacted()`, `IsAbs()`...)
  * Similarly, support more methods from `net/url.UserInfo` in the `Authority` type.
* However:
  * Let's keep the `Authority` part, as it better sticks to how the object is structured according to the RFC.
  * Let's keep the fluent `Builder` component. I don't think that exposing fields like in `URL` is a good choice.

2 Canonicalization (breaking change)
  * `URI.String()` currently just prints out the URL. This method should canonicalize the URI (case, simplified path, etc)

3 Strictness/compliance options (should not be breaking)
  * We should add options like `type Option func(*options)` to provide more flexibility when parsing & validating
  * In particular:
    * we should be able to abide strictly by the historical standard (no unicode, **puny code in host names should be validated**)
    (for punycode, let's take some inspiration from `https://github.com/jonasbn/punycode` and `https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/idna#Profile`)
    * callers should be able to opt in for IRI vs strict (historical) URI - e.g. only ASCII - rather than the current mixed 
    implementation (yet again, it was pragmatic...)
    * callers should be able to configure DNS schemes from options rather than overriding a package-level variable
    * default options could be set at the package level to save on systematic option resolution at parsing time
    (alternatively, expose a `Parser` type to wrap options once for a series of subsequent calls to `Parse()`/`Validate()`)
    * support canonicalization options with flags such as those defined in `https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/idna`

* Standard compliance improvements
  * Improve IRI support: current support for IRI is at best loose, albeit pragmatic
    (currently, a valid ALPHA token is a unicode letter codepoint, only ASCII digits are supported)

## Performance

The following could be part of a `v1.1.x`, as no breaking change occurs.

* reduce extraneous allocations spotted [in this WIP PR](https://github.com/fredbi/uri/pull/33)
* contemplate reducing the convenience of using `strings.Split()` to get a zero-allocation iterator over segments
* reduce the need to systematically call `url.PathUnescape()`, which is 
* move the internal pointer to `authorityInfo` to a plain struct: removes 1 extraneous allocation, simpler code
